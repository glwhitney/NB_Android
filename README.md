I simply felt like sharing my code and notes about the Android Beginners Tutorials.
The notes are in a Word document and the code is in text documents.
##Android Studio Version
This code was written using Android Studio 2.0.  This is important because the Blank Activity is now call the Basic Activity.
##Android Version 6
At the time of this writing, the latest Android is version 6.  This is important because
 * The tutorials were written at API21.
 * Which was before the Blank Activity included two xml layout files and an ActionBar and a Floating-Action-Button.
For this reason, my notes stress using an EmptyActivity template instead of a BlankActivity template.
It is also noteworthy to state that the ActionBarActivity has been *depreciated*. I point this out in my notes when it is relevant.
